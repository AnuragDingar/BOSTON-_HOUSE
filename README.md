# BOSTON HOUSE
This is a Python Program in Machine Learning to predict the correct value of a house.

# Working
We give 2 sets of data, training set and testing set. In training set, we use the data of known houses and their value and train our model based on that data.
And then using these trained data, we can predict the price value of unknown houses in Boston

# Which algorithm does it take?
For this particular problem, the machine model is using Linear Regression Algorithm.

# What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm. It's the most basic algorithm in Machine Learning It plots a straight line based on the scattered datapoints in a way the cost function is minimum.
And based on that line, it predicts the test value.
